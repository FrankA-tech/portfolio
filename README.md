The Gaming Room was a client seeking a scalable, platform-independent game application based on their already successful Android game, “Draw It or Lose It.” They wanted a version that could run across platforms and support multiple game sessions without conflict. My task was to design a solution that addressed performance, reusability, and cross-platform compatibility.

I think I did particularly well in laying out the system architecture clearly and defining class responsibilities. That made it easier not only to explain things to others but also to stay focused when developing. Going through this design process helped me understand the system’s structure before diving into code—it prevented a lot of backtracking later.

If I were to revise anything, I’d probably spend more time tightening up the sequence diagrams. They got the point across, but I think I could improve the clarity and flow to make the logic easier to follow.

Understanding the user's needs was central to the design. I translated those needs—like supporting multiple game instances and ensuring platform independence—into specific technical choices. Considering the user’s goals is crucial; it ensures the system actually solves the problem it was built for.

My design approach started with breaking the problem down into manageable pieces—user requirements, use cases, system structure—before getting into technical details. For future projects, I’d keep that approach but probably spend more time on early feedback loops, maybe mockups or prototypes, to validate decisions sooner.
